\description{
Load storm and year data from data repository.

\details{
This function is designed to give quicker access to post-scraped
storm data and may be modified in future releases.
\describe{
    \item{adv}{This data file contains base information for every storm
    advisory issued by the National Hurricane Center for the Atlantic and
    northeast Pacific oceans.}
    \item{discus}{Storm discussion text}
    \item{fcst}{Forecast positions of tropical cyclones}
    \item{fcst_wr}{Forecast wind radii data for each forecast observation in
    `fcst`}
    \item{fstadv}{Complete Forecast/Advisory data}
    \item{posest}{Position estimates}
    \item{prblty}{Strike probabilities for a given location. This product was
    deprecated after the 2005 hurricane season.}
    \item{public}{Public advisory text}
    \item{storms}{Summary for all storms in this dataset.}
    \item{update}{Update text}
    \item{wndprb}{Wind Speed Probabilities. Probability of a location
    experiencing minimum wind-speed values within a given forecast period.
    This product replaces Strike Probabilities after the 2005 hurricane
    season. May not exist for all cyclones.}
    \item{wr}{Current wind radius, if available, for a cyclone.}
}

Datasets 'discus', 'posest', 'public' and 'update' are not included as of
this writing but will be added as soon as possible.

'adv', 'fcst', 'fcst_wr', and 'wr' are tidied data of
\code{\link{get_fstadv}} using functions \code{\link{tidy_fcst}},
\code{\link{tidy_fcst_wr}}, \code{\link{tidy_fstadv}} and
\code{\link{tidy_wr}}.

See \url{https://timtrice.github.io/rrricanes/articles/articles/data_world.html}
for a third alternative to access datasets with the ability to filter data
without loading entire datasets into your environment.
